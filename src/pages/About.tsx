      <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        I'm a frontend developer with 2+ years of experience building
        enterprise-level medical imaging web applications using JavaScript,
        JQuery, and ASP.NET. I'm currently transitioning to React and TypeScript
        to build more modular, scalable UI systems.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I enjoy solving user-centric problems, optimizing UI performance, and
        delivering intuitive user experiences. I'm also familiar with backend
        concepts and database interaction (Oracle, PL/SQL) to support full-stack
        workflows.
